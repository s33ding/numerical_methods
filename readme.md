# Numerical Methods

This repository contains my projects and assignments related to the field of Numerical Methods.

## Description

Numerical methods are mathematical techniques used to solve problems that cannot be solved analytically, often involving the approximation of complex mathematical functions. These methods are widely used in engineering, physics, economics, and many other fields.

## Projects

- Bisection Method: implementation of the bisection method to find the root of a function.

## About Me
