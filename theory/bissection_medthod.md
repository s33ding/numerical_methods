Introduction
The bisection method is a numerical method used for finding the root of a function. It is a simple and robust method, and is guaranteed to converge to a root of the function under some mild conditions. The basic idea behind the bisection method is to repeatedly bisect the interval in which the root lies, and then to choose the subinterval in which the function changes sign as the new interval to search.

Algorithm
The algorithm of the bisection method is as follows:

Choose an initial interval $[a, b]$ such that $f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0$, i.e., the function changes sign over the interval.
Compute the midpoint $c = \frac{a + b}{2}$ of the interval.
Evaluate the function $f(c)$ at the midpoint.
If $f(c) = 0$, then stop; the midpoint is the root of the function.
If $f(a) \cdot f(c) < 0$, then the root lies in the interval $[a, c]$, so set $b = c$.
If $f(c) \cdot f(b) < 0$, then the root lies in the interval $[c, b]$, so set $a = c$.
Repeat steps 2-6 until a sufficiently accurate root is found.
Explanation
The bisection method works by repeatedly dividing the interval $[a, b]$ into two subintervals of equal size, and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign. This ensures that the bisection method converges to a root of the function, since it eliminates half of the interval on each iteration. Specifically, the bisection method guarantees that the interval containing the root is halved at each iteration, and so the root is isolated to an arbitrarily small interval after a finite number of iterations.

The key assumption that underlies the bisection method is that the function is continuous over the interval $[a, b]$. This ensures that the function changes sign at some point in the interval, which is a necessary condition for the method to work. Another important assumption is that the function is unimodal, i.e., it has only one root in the interval $[a, b]$. If the function has multiple roots, then the bisection method may converge to any one of them, depending on the initial interval and the function itself.

Overall, the bisection method is a simple and reliable numerical method for finding the root of a function. While it may not be the fastest or most efficient method, it is widely used in practice due to its simplicity and robustness.
