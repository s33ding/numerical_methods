The trapezoid rule is based on the idea that you can approximate the area under the curve by dividing it into small trapezoids and then adding up the areas of these trapezoids. In the case of the trapezoid rule being "repeated" or "composite," you divide the integration interval into n equal sub-intervals, apply the trapezoid rule on each of these sub-intervals, and sum the results.

The formula for the repeated trapezoid rule can be written as:

I â‰ˆ (h / 2) * [f(a) + 2 * sum from i=1 to n-1 of f(a + i*h) + f(b)]

where:

I is the approximated integral,
h is the step size (equal to (b - a) / n),
n is the number of sub-intervals,
a and b are the limits of integration,
f is the function to be integrated, and
the sum is the sum of the evaluations of the function at the interior points.
I hope this is helpful!
