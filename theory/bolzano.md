Bolzano's theorem, also known as the intermediate value theorem, is a fundamental result in real analysis that provides conditions for the existence of a root of a continuous function on an interval.

The theorem states that if a function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and takes values of opposite sign at the endpoints, i.e. f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that f(c) = 0.

This theorem is particularly useful for numerical methods that aim to find roots of functions, as it allows us to determine whether a root exists within a given interval before attempting to approximate its value. The bisection method is one such method that leverages Bolzano's theorem to iteratively refine an interval that contains a root until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.
